# javaDataVisualization
Projects to showcase different ways to visualize data and making it interactive using java.

The "Sorting" project will take as an input a text file containing unsorted numbers then visualize a sorting algorithm using multi threading to divide
the sorting and visuzalization actions and improve performace.

The "Tree Map" project analyzes a file system with a selected directory as the root node. Options to visualize by file age, type or permissions.
Hovering over a node will display the files path and size.

The parallel Coordinates prject visualizaes a large quantinty of data using the parallel lines method. Caveat of this approach is that large amounts of 
data pose a performance impact. Further improvements might be necessary to handle that type of data.
